<H2>Health Resources</H2>

<P>
Healthcare resources are especially important for military veterans, who often face unique mental health challenges and physical injuries as a result of their service. Access to mental health care—such as counseling, therapy, and peer support—helps veterans cope with PTSD, anxiety, depression, and the stresses of transitioning back to civilian life. Equally vital are medical services that address combat-related injuries, rehabilitation programs, and physical therapy to support recovery and improve quality of life. Together, these resources ensure that veterans receive the care and support they need to heal, regain independence, and thrive after their military service.</P>
